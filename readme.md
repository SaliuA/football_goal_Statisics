As football evolves towards greater inclusivity, the women’s game is garnering attention comparable to the men’s. We’ve all found ourselves engrossed in both men’s and women’s international soccer matches, occasionally pondering whether women’s international football matches yield more goals than men’s. This intriguing question forms the basis of an investigative article that promises to be a captivating read, but it necessitates a rigorous statistical hypothesis test for confirmation!

Recognizing the dynamic nature of the sport and the potential variability in performances across different tournaments, I’ve decided to confine the analysis to official FIFA World Cup matches (excluding qualifiers) from 2002-01-01 onwards.
I’ve compiled two datasets, each containing the results of every official men’s and women’s international football match since the 19th century, sourced from a reliable online platform. These datasets are stored in two CSV files: women_results.csv and men_results.csv.
The research question I aim to answer is:

Do women’s international soccer matches see more goals scored than men’s matches?

Assuming a 10% significance level, I propose the following null and alternative hypotheses:
H0​ : The average number of goals scored in women’s international soccer matches equals that of men’s matches.
HA​ : The average number of goals scored in women’s international soccer matches exceeds that of men’s matches.

The question i am are trying to determine the answer to is:

> Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?

I assume a **10% significance level**, and use the following null and alternative hypotheses:

$H_0$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.

$H_A$ : The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.

## Summary
In summay, we can conlude that ther are more goals scored in the women sport than the mens sport
